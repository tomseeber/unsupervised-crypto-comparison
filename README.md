# Crypto-Currency Analysis using PCA and K-Means
by Thomas Seeber

This analysis uses Crypto-Currency data set from the https://status.cryptocompare.com/ database.

The analyis and processing roughly proceeded in the following steps. 
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The analysis is in contained in this [Jupyter Notebook](crypto_clustering.ipynb)

## Analysis

While the K-means does give some unique clusters and information including 4 unique categorics, we need to do more analysis to understand what the distinct categories mean.
